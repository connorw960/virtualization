\maketitle

\noindent \textbf{Point total:} 4
\\ All homework assignments are weighted equally in the final grade. Point values are unique to each lab assignment.

\textbf{Note:} For all problems which ask you to explain your reasoning or show your work, you do not need to show every step of each calculation, but the answer should include an explanation \emph{written with words} of what you did.  Even when work is not required to be shown, itâ€™s a good idea to include anyways so that you can earn partial credit.

\section{Question [2 points]}

An easy way we can help prevent code duplication is by using macros in functions. We saw one example of this in Lab 1 with the \texttt{VMM\_GUEST} macro. In many of the hypercalls we have in JOS, we need to differentiate when we are running in the guest or host. Give an example of a C program that adds up all the numbers in an array when the macro is set, and multiplies them when the macro is not set.

\section{Question [1 point]}

In this lab, you will write some code to implement demand paging for JOS VMs. What is a buffer cache? What is demand paging? How do these methods impact the performance of the file system?

\section{Question [1 point]}

After completing the lab, provide a simple diagram (you can just use function names and arrows) of the workflow of the functions that get called when a guest VM tries to read from a file.
